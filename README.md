AI Study Assistant
The goal is to build an AI-powered study tracker that logs sessions,
analyzes performance, and recommends what to study next.

I added Streamlit to this project to create an interactive web interface for AI study assistant. Users can log study sessions, track total study time and confidence per subject, visualize their progress with charts (bar, pie, line), and see a daily progress bar based on planned study hours.
